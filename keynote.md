### Collections, Data, Research: perspectives at the National Library of France

From 2016 to 2019, the National Library of France (BnF) was engaged in a project called Corpus, aimed at exploring new services for researchers using digital collections as data. Starting from the idea of delivering big datasets of digitized material, web archives and metadata for text and data mining research projects, the Corpus initiative resulted in the definition of a wide array of services, including a physical space. This presentation will be the tale of this journey of librarians and academics through the vast land, still much to uncover, of digital humanities.

**Bio:**  
Emmanuelle Bermès is deputy director for services and networks at BnF since 2014. From 2003 to 2011, she worked at the National Library of France (BnF), first in digital libraries and digital preservation, then in metadata management. From 2011 to 2014, she was in charge of multimedia and digital services at the Centre Pompidou (Paris, France). In the course of her career, Emmanuelle has held a number of responsibilities at international level (within Europeana, the Library Linked Data W3C incubator group, the IFLA Semantic Web special interest group (SWSIG), the International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC), and the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) consortium). Within the BnF, Emmanuelle is leading the Corpus project, an initiative to create a digital scholarship service for researchers.
