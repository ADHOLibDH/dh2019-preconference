### Venue
The KB is a research library with a broad collection in the fields of Dutch history, culture and society. As a national library we aim to collect and store all (digital) publications that appear in the Netherlands, as well as a part of the international publications about the Netherlands.

The KB has planned to have digitised and OCRed its entire collection of books, periodicals and newspapers from 1470 onward by the year 2030. Over 70 million book, newspaper and magazine pages are currently available via the search portal delpher.nl and dbnl.org, but we also offer born digital collections, such as our web archive, which contains 33 TB of data and consist of more than 13.000 websites. In 2013, the KB has set up the KB Lab for experiments with the digital collection within the digital humanities: lab.kb.nl
