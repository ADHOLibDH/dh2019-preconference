#### CERL: Data for DH at Consortium of European Research Libraries  
*Marian Lefferts (Consortium of European Research Libraries)*

The Consortium of European Research Libraries (CERL – www.cerl.org) hosts a large number of databases related to early printed books (1450-1850) and manuscripts that are useful for those that study the history and economics of printing, the spread of ideas, or the knowledge networks of a by-gone age. In this presentation, Marian Lefferts, CERL Executive Manager, will give an overview of what is on offer and how you can access the data.

Short abstract:  
This presentation introduces the European Research Infrastructure CLARIN, its partnerships with research libraries and invites you to discuss potential future collaboration.

Long abstract:  
The Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure or CLARIN is a research infrastructure initiated to make digital language resources and tools from all over Europe and beyond accessible through a single sign-on online environment. CLARIN supports academic researchers as well as students, journalists and citizen-scientists interested in digital language resources, such as parliamentary records, social media data, newspaper archives and spoken corpora. In 2012, CLARIN received the status of European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) and as of 2016 CLARIN is recognized as an ESFRI Landmark. [1]

Research libraries have always played a vital role in CLARIN. National libraries actively participate in several of the 25 national CLARIN consortia. Clearly, libraries are some of the largest providers of digital resources used by linguists, historians, literary scholars and other researchers engaged in the (digital) social sciences and humanities. In addition, many libraries encourage digital scholarship by offering analytical tools, training and data management support. [2]

On a supranational level, CLARIN has a number of partnerships with large cultural heritage infrastructures. In 2017, CLARIN signed a Memorandum of Understanding with LIBER, the Association of European Research Libraries. The goal of the Memorandum is to engage in and share information about policy and advocacy activities of mutual interests such as copyright regulations, identification of opportunities for joint capacity building and planning, and cooperation on user involvement in the design of services. [3]

CLARIN is also a partner in the Digital Service Infrastructure of Europeana, an EU platform for digital cultural heritage. As a result of this partnership, a selection of Europeana records can be found in CLARIN’s main search engine, the Virtual Language Observatory. These records include newspapers from Austria, Finnish travel brochures and audio recordings of Romanian poetry. [4]

CLARIN ERIC continues to explore new ways to strengthen its relations with research libraries across the world and is very open to suggestions for further collaboration.
