#### The case for a citation index by the humanities, for the humanities
*Giovanni Colavizza (University of Amsterdam, Netherlands)*  
*Silvio Peroni (University of Bologna, Italy)*  
*Matteo Romanello (École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland)*

Short abstract:  
We propose and exemplify motivations and design requirements for a humanities citation index. We suggest ways to make the index collaborative, distributed and open.

Long abstract:  
Citation indexes are by now part of the research infrastructure in use by most scientists: a necessary tool in order to cope with increasing amounts of scientific literature being published. Commercial citation indexes are designed for the sciences and have uneven coverage and unsatisfactory characteristics for scholars in the humanities, while no broad-coverage citation index is proposed by a public organization. We argue that a citation index for the humanities is desirable, for four reasons: it would greatly improve the retrieval of sources, it would offer a way to interlink collections across repositories (such as archives and libraries), it would foster the adoption of metadata standards and best practices by all relevant actors (including libraries and publishers) and it would contribute data to fields such as bibliometrics and science studies. We also suggest that this citation index must be informed by a set of requirements relevant to the humanities, including comprehensive source coverage and substantial chronological depth. To substantiate our proposal, we showcase two infrastructure components of the envisaged humanities citation index: a prototype online application including a digital library and citation index for the historiography on Venice (named Venice Scholar), and two open linked data citation repositories made available by OpenCitations (i.e. the OpenCitations Corpus and the Crossref corpus COCI). The Venice Scholar digital library allows operators to curate machine-extracted citation data, which will then be federated by OpenCitations into its persistent triplestores of citation data. These citation data can be pulled and served via the Venice Scholar citation index: an open online application. We conclude by proposing that the humanities citation index should be created taking a collaborative, distributed and open effort, as made possible by the proposed infrastructure: taking inspiration from library catalogs and in collaboration with GLAM institutions, primarily libraries.

#### Keyword searchable digital library of Serbian historic newspapers: Building the national infrastructure
*Adam Sofronijevic (University of Belgrade library)*  
*Tamara Šević (Ministry of Culture and Media of Republic of Serbia, University of Belgrade)*

Short abstract:  
The paper presents the process of building the national infrastructure that allows for keyword searchable digital library of Serbian historic newspapers.

Long abstract:  
The paper presents the process of building the national infrastructure that allows for keyword searchable digital library of Serbian historic newspapers. The infrastructure building encompass implementation of technical infrastructure, defining and setting up the working processes and drafting and making legal documents official. The process started in 2013 when University library Belgrade and National library of Serbia took part in Europeana newspaper project that allowed for first METS-ALTO files of Serbian historic newspapers to be created at project partner institution - University of Innsbruck. The first step in building technical infrastructure was creation of keyword searchable digital library at University library Belgrade that provides search and display of digitized historical newspapers and other documents. The website [http://www.unilib.rs/istorijske-novine/browse](http://www.unilib.rs/istorijske-novine/browse) offers simple and advanced search interfaces, and an interface for browsing through the digitized works. The website relies on the BnLViewer software by the National Library of Luxembourg to display digitized METS-ALTO documents, while the search backend uses Lucene/Solr search engine with enhancements made by the University library Belgrade. The website infrastructure is presented in the paper in some details. Collection descriptions and other texts of the website itself are published under the CreativeCommons Attribution (CC-BY) license, to facilitate their reuse in other projects. In 2015 a proprietary software has been acquired for creation of METS-ALTO files - docWorks by CCS Hamburg. University library Belgrade and National library of Serbia got one Basic license each and few years the second biggest library in Serbia, Matica sprska Library, acquired one license as well. The paper presents in some detail the process of creation of compatible work processes in these three libraries accomplished through project and other special activities. Activities that provided for training of librarians and volunteers to allow them to work with this software is also depicted. Collaboration with different smaller libraries from Serbia and the region that provided jpg images to be refined with docWorks is described along with defining the role of libraries that are content providers and promoters of keyword searchable digital library infrastructure. Most recent steps in building technical infrastructure such as additional design and branding of the interface so that it is more functional and branded as central point of access to historic newspapers in Serbia supported by six big libraries and hosted in government data center are explained. The paper specially present the process of drafting and making legal documents regarding keyword searchable digital library of Serbian historic newspapers official. In November of 2018 document entitled National framework for digitization of periodicals has been signed by four big libraries and ministry of culture and information of Republic of Serbia. This document establish METS-ALTO as recommended format for digitizing newspapers and other periodicals in Republic of Serbia. The legal documents drafted in 2019 that allow for implementation of the National framework are also presented. Paper also presents aspects of the process of building this national infrastructure that encompass collaboration with private companies, media, publishers and other stakeholders.

#### Digitizing for impact: from pixels to scholarship
*Eric Shows (New York Public Library, United States)*  
*Sara Rubinow (New York Public Library, United States)*  
*Matt Knutzen (New York Public Library, United States)*

Short abstract:  
We’ll explore how transforming collections into a digital form can multiply research impact and how partnering with research communities can influence the library’s Digital Collections strategy.

Long abstract:  
To further increase the discoverability, access, and use of the New York Public Library’s collections, digitization offers our patrons manifold possibilities for research and a deep dive into the Library’s encyclopedic holdings. Over the past decade, we have established clear rationales, processes, and workflows for digitizing research collections at the New York Public Library and are dedicated to building partnerships to explore how transforming collections into a digital form can multiply research impact.

In this presentation, we’ll take a closer look at the complete digitization life cycle for a single collection, from direct patron request and conversations with curators to online publishing, museum exhibition, and structured data extraction. To surface this largely invisible work, we’ll discuss the roles that the Library’s Digital Imaging Unit, Metadata Services Unit, Registrar’s Office, and Rights teams play in that life cycle. Along the way, we’ll look at the opportunities for scholarship that arise when research materials have been digitized and become available online through our digital portals.

We’ll discuss recent successes that aid genealogical research and our understanding of the urban landscape, experiments in computer vision to develop new ways of seeing and organizing items in a collection, and the latent potential in some recently digitized collections and corresponding research implications. We’ll also discuss how feedback from researchers about the rising baseline expectations around collections as data has begun to influence how we prioritize digitization projects and how we think about partnering with the scholarly community.

#### The role of CLARIN and linguistic annotation in the digital transformation in research
*Martin Wynne (Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford, United Kingdom)*

Short abstract:  
The CLARIN research infrastructure supports the linguistic annotation of digital texts, which allows smarter searching, and can make new forms of research possible.

Long abstract:  
Large and growing quantities of textual materials are being made available by libraries in digital form. Many library users will find that this is a convenient way to discover and read texts, but digital texts can offer much more than a shortcut to the delivery of texts to readers. Digital texts can be searched, clusters and patterns of words can be identified, and changes in language usage over time can be traced. Corpus linguistics has developed advanced techniques for the storing, annotating, searching, exploring, and visualizing results. Resources and techniques which have been developed for the purposes of addressing linguistic research questions can also be used to explore and analyse the content of texts, by researchers in disciplines across the human and social sciences. While these opportunities are currently being exploited in many projects, there is still not yet a concerted effort to make all digital texts available in suitable formats to facilitate this sort of digital research. What more do digital libraries need to do in order to make texts available in ways that can really support advanced digital scholarship?

This question has been addressed via surveys of existing practice via the networks of the CLARIN research infrastructure, and via experimental services offered by projects within the Bodleian Libraries at the University of Oxford. The conclusion has been drawn that minimum levels of annotation are necessary for text collections in digital libraries.

Annotation of texts should include structural markup, metadata, and linguistic annotation, including:
* Standardized metadata for basic categories such as language, relevant dates, author, title and text type;
* Part-of-speech tagging;
* Lemmatization; and
* Modernized (or otherwise normalized) forms, where historical or other forms of variation are likely to be a barrier to effective search.

When these annotations are made searchable, it can enable the following:
* Enhanced search, for inflected and variant forms of words;
Cross-searching the content of numerous texts, with results refined on the basis of content and metadata values;
* Visualization of results;
* 'Distant reading', data mining and extraction of results across large numbers of texts;
* Limited access via search and exploration interfaces to restricted texts, which would otherwise not be available to readers;
* Application of further levels of annotation and analysis by users based on the basic levels of annotation;
* Linking to resources held in other repositories, allowing cross-repository resource discovery and content search.

How can it be achieved? The preliminary results will be presented of a CLARIN initiative to gather information on NLP for the annotation of historical documents, and efforts to make it easier for resource curators to use the annotation tools.

Some challenges remain. Digital libraries are not necessarily centres of expertise in NLP, and some new initiatives and collaborations are often necessary. The repository will need to develop and maintain interfaces, which need development and maintenance, and to offer user support. The suggested annotations are likely to be considered provisional, and subject to ongoing updates, improvement and enhancement.
