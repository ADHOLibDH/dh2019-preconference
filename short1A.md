#### Finding new environments for cooperation with digital research and new values for heritage collections: experiences at the National Library of Spain
*Elena Sánchez Nogales (National Library of Spain)*

Short abstract:  
Reusable open data, crowdsourcing…  and more. Sharing the strategies developed at the National Library of Spain to strengthen, support and multiply connections with digital research.

Long abstract:  
The National Library of Spain (BNE, Biblioteca Nacional de España), preserving the most important bibliographic and documentary collection in the country, has historically had a close and deep relationship with the research community.

Digitisation of collections, initiated in a massive way in 2008, changed the nature of this relationship, and while expanding and improving access to resources, it also implied the new risk of losing a direct (‘physical’) connection with researchers and their needs, and losing visibility of how the Library resources were used.

Over the last years, the BNE has worked to strengthen, support and multiply connections with digital research. Calling for proposals of new digitisations and actively cooperating in digital projects was a first step, but the Library continued beyond by setting a specific strategy to promote the use and reuse of data and digital resources within the framework of their BNElab, ([https://bnelab.bne.es/en/](https://bnelab.bne.es/en/)). It comprises different lines of action 2018-2022, in cooperation with a community of experts in digital transformation and of course with researchers.

One of these lines looks at collections as data, and here catalogues (bibliographic and authorities) and other data produced by the Library, have been converted into open reusable formats and published in a dedicated space [https://bnelab.bne.es/en/data/](https://bnelab.bne.es/en/data/) - as well as in official open data catalogues.

Helped by experts in data and digital humanities, the Library is promoting the use of these new resources. And the process is also having an interesting internal dimension: ‘questioning’ these data files from a researcher’s view has enabled cataloguing teams and digital collections managers to learn about new uses for our catalogues, and also be aware about digital researchers needs, problems posed by our data and enrichment possibilities. By using tools such as Open Refine, considering new external sources for integration or learning about visualization tools, this work has indeed initiated a change in the way we look at our data and cataloguing practices, and at our catalogue as an information tool itself (beyond description and discovery).

But the Library is also offering new tools and digital platforms such as the 'Interactive books' project or ComunidadBNE ([https://comunidad.bne.es/](https://comunidad.bne.es/)), a crowdsourcing initiative recently launched and very well received by the general public and also by academic and research groups. ComunidadBNE is conceived as a digital environment of collaboration between general public, specialists and librarians, for cooperative transcription, geo-referencing, identification or tagging of images from the Library’s digital resources, and also for the enrichment of the bibliographic catalogue and authorities. The platform was built on an open source base code, Pybossa – adapted, developed, and also made open and licensed for free reuse in GitHub.
Since the initiative was presented, different research groups have already confirmed interest in participating and using the platform for their academic projects.

This paper proposal aims at sharing the strategy, experience and initial results, as well as future projects within these new lines of action at the BNE.

Cultural Heritage Labs help people to innovate and experiment with digital collections. We will present our growing ‘Labs’ international community and outline our future activities.

Long abstract:  
‘Cultural Heritage Labs’ in galleries, libraries, archives and museums around the world help researchers, artists, entrepreneurs, educators and innovators to work on, experiment, incubate and develop their ideas of working with digital content through competitions, awards, projects, exhibitions and other engagement activities. They do this by providing services and infrastructure to enable, facilitate and give access to their data both openly online and onsite for research, inspiration and enjoyment.

In September 2018, the British Library Labs team organised a ‘Building Library Labs’' international workshop. The event provided the opportunity for colleagues that are planning or already have digital experimental ‘Labs’ to share knowledge, experiences and lessons learned. The workshop, which attracted over 40 institutions from North America, Europe, Middle East, Asia and Africa, demonstrated a clear need and enthusiasm for establishing an international support network. Within 6 months, a second international workshop was organised at the Royal Danish Library in Copenhagen in March 2019. In total we have brought together some 120 participants and an even wider community of around 250 people online. Some have been sharing their experiences in setting, using and running innovation labs, but there was a sizeable group of attendees who are planning to set up such labs and need advice and support in how to do this.

The aim of this short paper is to present the journey and development of the International Labs community and outline our future activities.

The principle of the network is that by fair sharing and ‘paying forward’ our expertise, knowledge and experiences, the group hopes to ensure that organisations don’t have to ‘re-invent the wheel’. Organisations can learn from each other and enable collaboration across borders through their digital collections, data, services, infrastructure and practice. This we hope this will result in building better digital ‘Labs’ for their organisations and their users and help to further open up data and services for everyone.

People are the essence of the international Labs network. From the results of an initial global Building Library Labs survey,  including 40 responses from 23 countries, there was significant interest from the wider cultural heritage sector, beyond libraries. With currently 250 people, from over 60 institutions, based in over 30 countries affiliated with the network, a solid set of communication tools were needed. The network has a shared Google drive, a mailing list and a Wiki, as well as an active WhatsApp group, a Slack channel and meets regularly via Zoom.  

With two successful events behind us, and plenty of enthusiasm and willingness to continue activities further, we now looking to the future. Planned activities include: a book sprint to capture significant knowledge and expertise within the Labs network serving as a reference guide for people wanting to build their own lab, populating our wiki and creating a global directory of Cultural Heritage labs. Further regional and international events have and are also being organised. In less than a year, the Labs network has come a long way, and this is only the beginning!

#### Collaboration with the Researchers – Content, Presentation systems and Techniques
*Tuula Pääkkönen (National Library of Finland)*  
*Jussi-Pekka Hakkarainen (National Library of Finland)*

Short abstract:  
This talk tells about the researcher services evolution in National Library of Finland (data clinics, data catalogue and presentation system features), now and in the future.

Long abstract:  
In the National Library of Finland, there is constant attempt to facilitate discussion with researchers in many ways. In the annual summit of the Helsinki Centre of Digital Humanities the opening words of the new approach towards the researcher user segment  (Lilja and Hakkarainen 2018),  was a welcomed step by the researcher community. The communication approach of the National Library vary in size. There are  1-on-1 meetings, small group events in so called “morning coffee” sessions where researchers can present their work and how they utilize the collections. Then recently there has been data-clinics, where in an on-site workshops, where the programmatic ways how to utilize the data from the collections are explained. In this talk, we approach the research questions, what kind of documentation different researchers would need from the content, presentation systems and techniques?  Are the end-user documentation (screen casts, basic user guides) enough also for the researchers, or is there need for more?

Recently we created an initial version of the instructions on how to utilize the collections on their own, i.e. self-help instructions on how to download desired parts of the collections or metadata. This is a local experiment bit similar to the Programming Historian (PH 2019). Our focus has been to answer to the most common questions of the researchers and enable them to help them to help themselves. While doing this toolset we realized, that the contextual bubble within the library differs from that of the researchers of themselves. We need to benchmark good practices to overcome the possible technological barriers researchers might face (Zhang, Liu, and Mathews 2015) and evaluate the strategy of the future.

Discussion with the researchers in the data-clinics has turned out to be very effective.  The data-clinics, as a face-to-face meeting, lowers the communication threshold.  We need to learn new ways for the cross-institutional collaboration (Nyhan and Fay 2015) and embrace the collaborative nature of the digital humanities (Wong 2016) in different lifecycle phases of the library service creation.  We need to investigate further the expectations for the National Library and towards our contact points in other organizations – together we could weave a network where each organization can provide some aspect to bring a more coherent whole. In the long run, this helps the researches, which helps in the increasing the societal impact of the collections.

Short abstract:  
This paper presents how the KB collaborates with researchers in various forms to better serve their needs but also to improve our own services.

Long abstract:  
The KB National Library of the Netherlands has been actively engaged with digital humanities through collaborations with academia. This paper present how the KB is partnering with the research community on digital humanities projects using the more than 100 million digitised pages of printed text. Since our digitisation started in the 1990s our focus shifted from the physical to the digital collection. We actively search for partners in the research community to use and study our digitised materials, with support from research software engineers in the digital humanities team of the KB.

Of course, collaboration is easier when access to the data is easy. This is why in 2013 a data services coordinator was installed in the library. Providing researchers with a single contact person to get access to the APIs and how to work with them facilitates use of the collections.

We aim to collaborate with researchers in different stages in their career. Since 2004, we have had the KB/NIAS Fellowship (kb.nl/en/organisation/kb-fellowship). This fellowship programme went from a programme for foreign researchers focused on the physical collections (2004-2013) to a national fellowship for professors working in the digital humanities (2014-2018) who were invited to spend a research sabbatical in the library for 5 months.

A similar programme was launched in 2014, aimed at early-career researchers: the funded researcher-in-residence programme ([kb.nl/en/organisation/research-expertise/researcher-in-residence](kb.nl/en/organisation/research-expertise/researcher-in-residence)), which works with a yearly call for proposals. Two researchers are selected by a committee of scholars from various disciplines and two library representatives. They spend 6 months working part-time in the Research department, together with the DH team. All output is published on the KB Lab ([lab.kb.nl](lab.kb.nl)).

Through the years we have built up a network of researchers through these forms of collaboration. We found that they are often looking for real world cases for their students to work on, as theses or research projects. We regularly have interns in the Research department or provide data and cases to students working on a project assignment.

Another type of collaboration that we have pursued recently aims to obtain input from several researchers at a time for a specific case that we formulate. For instance in the ICT with Industry workshop ([ict-research.nl/ict-with-industry/ictwi2019/#case1](ict-research.nl/ict-with-industry/ictwi2019/#case1)), organised by the ICT-research Platform Netherlands, where a team of researchers spend a full week working on a problem put before them by industry. We are also trying out this approach by providing data to benchmarking contests, such as DMAS ([primaresearch.org/DMAS2019/](primaresearch.org/DMAS2019/)). Asking for input from researchers to help solve issues we have in the library means we get a broad view of possible solutions while also contributing to the scholarly community with research topics with practical applications.

This paper will present the various forms of collaboration described above, and will go into more detail about lessons learned and recommendations for collaboration with researchers as a library.

#### Next Generation of Scalable and Sustainable DH Services
*Zach Coble (New York University Libraries, United States)*

This talk will discuss the recent evolution and alignment of digital humanities support, services, and infrastructure at NYU, in particular infrastructure building collaborations between Libraries and IT.

Long abstract:  
This talk will discuss the recent evolution and alignment of digital humanities activities at NYU Libraries. While the Digital Scholarship Services (DSS) department is the public face of digital humanities at the library, our support, services, and infrastructure increasingly rely on collaborations between several departments across Libraries and IT.

For context, the scalable and sustainable approach to digital humanities in libraries, developed by DSS co-founders Jennifer Vinopal and Monica McCormick over seven years ago, has continued to guide our growth as we have adapted our approach to meet new needs. One of the core practices of this approach is to not embed ourselves in long-term projects that inevitably sink staff time and resources into maintaining projects that scholars gradually lose interest in. Instead, we provide training, services, and infrastructure that empower scholars to create, publish, and preserve their work. More recently, we have focused on empowering users by developing technical infrastructure that meets their unique needs, which is the result of taking a broad look and identifying similarities in the computational needs among DHers and scholars in other disciplines.

One aspect of this I will briefly touch on is our success in solving the “faculty website problem” using Reclaim Hosting’s Domain of One’s Own service. But perhaps more interesting is our work taking place under the umbrella of “Digital Repository Services for Researchers” (DRSR) This multi-phase project is a collaboration between several Libraries departments and the Research Technology group in Central IT to build and develop a robust suite of repository services that meet user's complex needs at each stage of the research lifecycle, including discovery, access, publication, and preservation. For example, we have recently launched Research Workspace, a repository service providing fast, reliable, mountable storage for management of large-scale research data. Our Collections as Data work now lives on Research Workspace, and these collections can be easily mounted to a researcher's laptop or NYU's high performance computing cluster for analysis.

This talk will outline NYU Libraries’ current iteration of sustainable and scalable services, with a focus on the goals of our DRSR work. I will also provide use cases to describe in practical terms how NYU’s DH community has benefited from this work.

#### Forschungspartnerschaften zu welchem Preis?
*Jesko Reiling (Zentralbibliothek Zürich, Switzerland)*

Short abstract:  
Der Beitrag erläutert die organisatorischen und finanziellen Aufwendungen, welche die Zentralbibliothek Zürich aufbringen muss(te), um sich (längerfristig) als Forschungsbibliothek etablieren zu können.  

Long abstract:  
Die Zentralbibliothek Zürich (ZB) unterstützt seit einigen Jahren universitäre Forschungsprojekte und ist 2018 erstmals eine Forschungskooperation mit einem Editionsprojekt eingegangen. Zusammen mit dem Editionsteam der Johann Caspar Lavater (1740-1801) Briefausgabe erarbeitet sie seither für die online-Briefedition ([lavater.com](lavater.com)) Metadaten und produziert zudem rund 110'000 Digitalisate der Korrespondenz. Dafür zahlt sie einen hohen Preis, der im Referat eingehender und aus verschiedenen Blickwinkeln zur Sprache kommen soll.

Der Beitrag illustriert anhand des Lavater-Pilotprojekts die Herausforderungen für eine Bibliothek, wenn sie sich als Forschungspartnerin aufstellen will. Vorgestellt werden die erforderlichen Ressourcen, die notwendigen organisatorischen Entwicklungsmassnahmen sowie betriebswirtschaftliche Mittel, die es braucht, um ein Einzelprojekt abzuwickeln und sich darüber hinaus längerfristig als Forschungspartnerin zu etablieren. Die Erfahrung zeigt, dass es eminent wichtig ist, die institutionellen Prozesse und Workflows ebenso umfassend wie detailliert zu identifizieren. So braucht es z.B. nicht nur Fachpersonal für die Erschliessung und das Scannen der Briefe, darüber hinaus mussten auch weitgehende restauratorische Massnahmen ergriffen werden, um die Digitalisierung des Materials überhaupt erst zu ermöglichen. Im Weiteren mussten auch technische Entwicklungen veranlasst werden, um der Edition den Datenimport auf die gewünschte Art und Weise zu ermöglichen.

Trotz Forschungsgelder durch den Schweizerischen Nationalfonds (SNF), dem nationalen Förderer universitärer Forschung, muss die ZB den Grossteil der Kosten selber bestreiten. Das Referat zeigt die enorme Kluft zwischen den gesprochenen und den benötigten Geldern detailliert auf. Hier stellt sich diejenige Frage, die wohl alle Bibliotheken beschäftigt: Bis zu welchem Preis kann man als Bibliothek (längerfristig) Forschungspartnerschaften eingehen?

Dabei gilt es freilich auch die Vorteile von Forschungskooperationen zu bedenken: durch Forschungsgelder eröffnen sich GLAM-Institutionen zusätzliche Möglichkeiten der Erschliessung: Es können weitere, bislang unerschlossene Bestände aufgearbeitet werden oder man kann einen Bestand noch genauer und vertiefter erschliessen. Als Forschungspartnerin kommt man als Bibliothek dem eigenen institutionellen Sammlungs-, Erschliessungs- und Vermittlungsauftrag nach. Zudem trägt jedes Forschungsprojekt dazu bei, den eigenen Bestand sichtbarer zu machen. Das kann schlussendlich zu weiteren Folgeprojekten führen.

Die ZB, davon soll abschliessend die Rede sein, entwickelt(e) deshalb (erstmals in ihrer Geschichte) eine Forschungsstrategie. Ein Teil davon ist es, zusätzliches (geisteswissenschaftlich und bibliothekarisch geschultes, aber auch technisch ausgebildetes) Fachpersonal einzustellen. Diese Mitarbeitende sollen nicht mehr, wie bis anhin, lediglich in einer Fachabteilung (Handschriften, Alte Drucke, Graphik oder Karten etc.) tätig sein, sondern arbeiten als ‘Universalisten’ fachbereichsübergreifend in zukünftigen Forschungsprojekten und -kooperationen mit. Mit diesen neuen Strukturen will sich die ZB als zuverlässige und effiziente Forschungspartnerin profilieren.
